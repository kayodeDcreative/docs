<Note>
**Most users don't need this!** If you're using Framer, check out our [simple one-script installation](/framer) instead.
</Note>

The Gately SDK is for developers who need programmatic access to authentication features. Most Framer users should use our simple embed script instead.

# Installation

The Gately SDK can be installed and used in multiple ways. Choose the method that best fits your project setup.

## Quick Start

### Method 1: Script Tag (Recommended for most projects)

Add the Gately SDK to your HTML page:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.usegately.com/gately.min.js"></script>
```

The SDK will be automatically available as `window.gately` and `window.GatelyBrowserClient`.

### Method 2: ES Module Import

For modern JavaScript projects using ES modules:

```javascript
import { GatelyBrowserClient } from 'https://cdn.usegately.com/gately-sdk.esm.min.js'
```

### Method 3: Versioned Import (Production)

For production applications that need version stability:

```javascript
import { GatelyBrowserClient } from 'https://cdn.usegately.com/sdk/v1.1.0/gately-sdk.esm.min.js'
```

## Framework Integration

### React

#### Script Tag Method
```html
<script src="https://cdn.usegately.com/gately.min.js"></script>
```

```jsx
import React from 'react'

function App() {
  const { user, login, logout, isAuthenticated } = window.gately.useGately('your-project-id')
  
  // Your React component logic
}
```

#### ES Module Method
```jsx
import { useGately } from 'https://cdn.usegately.com/gately-sdk.esm.min.js'

function App() {
  const { user, login, logout, isAuthenticated } = useGately('your-project-id')
  
  // Your React component logic
}
```

### Vue

```javascript
import { useGately } from 'https://cdn.usegately.com/gately-sdk.esm.min.js'

export default {
  setup() {
    const { user, login, logout, isAuthenticated } = useGately('your-project-id')
    
    return {
      user,
      login,
      logout,
      isAuthenticated
    }
  }
}
```

### Svelte

```javascript
import { createGatelyStore } from 'https://cdn.usegately.com/gately-sdk.esm.min.js'

const gatelyStore = createGatelyStore('your-project-id')
```

```typescript
import { GatelyService } from 'https://cdn.usegately.com/gately-sdk.esm.min.js'

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class GatelyService {

}
```

## Node.js Usage

## TypeScript Support

The SDK includes full TypeScript support. When using ES modules, you'll get automatic type checking:

```typescript
import { GatelyBrowserClient, User, Session } from 'https://cdn.usegately.com/gately-sdk.esm.min.js'

const gately = new GatelyBrowserClient('your-project-id')

async function handleLogin(): Promise<{ user: User; session: Session }> {
  return await gately.login('user@example.com', 'password')
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

The Gately SDK supports all modern browsers:

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
