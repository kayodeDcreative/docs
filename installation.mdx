---

The Gately SDK is designed to work across multiple environments and frameworks. Choose the installation method that best fits your project.

## NPM Installation

Install the SDK using npm or yarn:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @gately/sdk
```


```bash yarn
yarn add @gately/sdk
```


```bash pnpm
pnpm add @gately/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## CDN Installation

For simple HTML pages or when you can't use a package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```html ESM Module
<script type="module">
  import { GatelyBrowserClient } from 'https://cdn.usegately.com/sdk/latest/gately-sdk.esm.min.js'
  
  const gately = new GatelyBrowserClient('your-project-id')
</script>
```


```html UMD Bundle
<script src="https://cdn.usegately.com/sdk/latest/gately.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const gately = new Gately.GatelyBrowserClient('your-project-id')
</script>
```

</CodeGroup>

## Basic Setup

Initialize the SDK with your project ID:

```javascript
import { GatelyBrowserClient } from '@gately/sdk'

// Initialize the client
const gately = new GatelyBrowserClient('your-project-id')

// Optional: Configure additional options
const gately = new GatelyBrowserClient('your-project-id', {
  apiUrl: 'https://sdk.usegately.com', // Custom API URL
  autoRefresh: true // Auto-refresh tokens (default: true)
})
```

## Framework-Specific Setup

### React

```jsx
import { useGately } from '@gately/sdk'

function App() {
  const { user, login, logout, loading } = useGately('your-project-id')
  
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  
  return (
    <div>
      {user ? (
        <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => login('email', 'password')}>Login</button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Vue 3

```javascript
import { useGately } from '@gately/sdk/adapters/vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const { user, login, logout, loading } = useGately('your-project-id')
    
    return {
      user,
      login,
      logout,
      loading
    }
  }
}
```

### Svelte

```javascript
import { createGatelyStore } from '@gately/sdk/adapters/svelte'

const gately = createGatelyStore('your-project-id')

// In your Svelte component
<script>
  import { gately } from './stores/gately.js'
  
  $: user = $gately.user
  $: loading = $gately.loading
  
  function handleLogin() {
    gately.login('email', 'password')
  }
</script>
```

## Environment Variables

For production applications, use environment variables to store your project ID:

<CodeGroup>

```bash .env.local
VITE_GATELY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
GATELY_API_URL=https://sdk.usegately.com
```


```javascript Usage
const gately = new GatelyBrowserClient(
  import.meta.env.VITE_GATELY_PROJECT_ID,
  {
    apiUrl: import.meta.env.VITE_GATELY_API_URL
  }
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## TypeScript Support

The SDK includes full TypeScript support out of the box:

```typescript
import { GatelyBrowserClient, User, Session } from '@gately/sdk'

const gately = new GatelyBrowserClient('your-project-id')

// Type-safe user data
const user: User | null = gately.getUser()
const session: Session | null = gately.getSession()

// Type-safe authentication
if (gately.isAuthenticated()) {
  console.log('User is authenticated:', user?.email)
}
```
