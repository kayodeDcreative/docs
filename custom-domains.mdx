# Custom Domains for Gately

## Overview

Custom domains allow you to use your own domain (e.g., `auth.yourcompany.com`) for external SDK authentication instead of Gately's default domain. This provides a seamless, branded experience for your users when they authenticate through your applications.

## Features

- **Branded Authentication**: Users authenticate through your domain instead of Gately's
- **SSL Certificates**: Automatic SSL certificate provisioning
- **Domain Verification**: Built-in DNS verification process
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time domain status tracking
- **SDK Integration**: Easy integration with external SDKs and applications

## Requirements

- **Paid Plan**: Custom domains are available for Starter plan and above
- **DNS Access**: Ability to modify DNS records for your domain
- **Domain Ownership**: You must own the domain you want to use

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Configure Your Custom Domain

1. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Custom Domain** in your Gately dashboard
2. Enter your desired subdomain (e.g., `auth.yourcompany.com`)
3. Enable the custom domain checkbox
4. Click **Save Domain Settings**

### Step 2: DNS Configuration

After adding your domain, you'll need to configure DNS records:

#### CNAME Record
Add a CNAME record pointing your subdomain to Gately's servers:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: auth (or your chosen subdomain)
Value: custom-domains.usegately.com
TTL: 300 (or your DNS provider's default)
```

#### Example DNS Configuration
```
auth.yourcompany.com â†’ CNAME â†’ custom-domains.usegately.com
```

### Step 3: Verification

1. After DNS configuration, verification typically takes 5-15 minutes
2. Check the status in your Custom Domain settings page
3. Status indicators:
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Pending Verification**: DNS propagation in progress
   - ðŸŸ¢ **Active**: Domain is verified and SSL is provisioned
   - ðŸ”´ **Verification Failed**: DNS configuration issue

### Step 4: SSL Certificate Provisioning

Once DNS verification is complete:
- SSL certificates are automatically provisioned
- This process typically takes 2-5 minutes
- Your domain will show "Active" status when ready

## SDK Integration

Once your custom domain is active, use these URLs in your external applications:

### Authentication Endpoints

#### Google OAuth
```
https://auth.yourcompany.com/api/auth/google
```

#### GitHub OAuth
```
https://auth.yourcompany.com/api/auth/github
```

#### Base Auth URL
```
https://auth.yourcompany.com
```

### Example SDK Configuration

#### JavaScript SDK
```javascript
const gately = new GatelySDK({
  baseURL: 'https://auth.yourcompany.com',
  projectId: 'your-project-id'
});

// Google OAuth
await gately.auth.google();

// GitHub OAuth
await gately.auth.github();
```

#### React Integration
```jsx
import { GatelyProvider } from '@gately/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <GatelyProvider
      baseURL="https://auth.yourcompany.com"
      projectId="your-project-id"
    >
      <YourApp />
    </GatelyProvider>
  );
}
```

## OAuth Provider Configuration

### Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** â†’ **Credentials**
3. Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
4. Add your custom domain to **Authorized redirect URIs**:
   ```
   https://auth.yourcompany.com/api/auth/google/callback
   ```

### GitHub OAuth Setup

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Edit your OAuth App
3. Update the **Authorization callback URL**:
   ```
   https://auth.yourcompany.com/api/auth/github/callback
   ```

## Domain Status Reference

| Status | Description | Action Required |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Pending Verification** | DNS propagation in progress | Wait 5-15 minutes |
| **Verifying** | Checking DNS configuration | No action needed |
| **Active** | Domain verified and SSL provisioned | Ready to use |
| **Verification Failed** | DNS configuration issue | Check DNS records |
| **SSL Provisioning Failed** | SSL certificate issue | Contact support |
| **Disabled** | Domain manually disabled | Re-enable if needed |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### DNS Propagation Delays
- **Issue**: Domain stuck in "Pending Verification"
- **Solution**: DNS changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate globally
- **Check**: Use `dig` or online DNS checkers to verify CNAME record

#### Incorrect DNS Configuration
- **Issue**: "Verification Failed" status
- **Solution**: Verify CNAME record points to `custom-domains.usegately.com`
- **Common mistakes**:
  - Using A record instead of CNAME
  - Incorrect target domain
  - Missing subdomain

#### SSL Certificate Issues
- **Issue**: "SSL Provisioning Failed" status
- **Solution**: Contact Gately support
- **Note**: This is rare and usually resolves automatically

### DNS Verification Commands

Check your DNS configuration:

```bash
# Check CNAME record
dig auth.yourcompany.com CNAME

# Check from different DNS servers
dig @8.8.8.8 auth.yourcompany.com CNAME
dig @1.1.1.1 auth.yourcompany.com CNAME
```

Expected output:
```
auth.yourcompany.com. 300 IN CNAME custom-domains.usegately.com.
```

## Security Considerations

### SSL/TLS
- All custom domains use TLS 1.2+ encryption
- Automatic certificate renewal
- HSTS headers enabled for security

### Domain Validation
- DNS-based domain ownership verification
- Prevents unauthorized domain usage
- Regular re-validation for active domains

### Access Control
- Only project owners can configure custom domains
- Domain configuration requires authentication
- Audit logs for domain changes

## API Reference

### Get Custom Domains
```http
GET /api/custom-domains?project_id={projectId}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

### Add Custom Domain
```http
POST /api/custom-domains
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "projectId": "uuid",
  "domain": "auth.yourcompany.com"
}
```

### Delete Custom Domain
```http
DELETE /api/custom-domains/{domainId}
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

## Limitations

- **One domain per project**: Each project can have one active custom domain
- **Subdomain only**: Root domains are not supported for security reasons
- **DNS requirements**: Must be able to create CNAME records
- **Paid plans only**: Feature requires Starter plan or higher

## Best Practices

### Domain Selection
- Use a dedicated subdomain (e.g., `auth.`, `login.`, `sso.`)
- Keep it short and memorable
- Avoid special characters or numbers

### DNS Management
- Use a reliable DNS provider
- Set appropriate TTL values (300-3600 seconds)
- Monitor DNS propagation after changes

### Security
- Regularly monitor domain status
- Keep OAuth provider configurations updated
- Use HTTPS-only in your applications
