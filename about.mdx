We provide the essential tools for authentication, user management, payments, and more, so you can focus on building your business, not your infrastructure.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to democratize software development by providing a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use platform that empowers both no-code creators and developers to build amazing things. We believe that building a successful online business shouldn't be limited by technical expertise or resources.

## Extensible for Custom Solutions

For those who need to go beyond our no-code offerings, Gately provides a powerful JavaScript SDK that gives you full control over your application's backend.

### The Gately SDK

- **Payments and Billing:** Integrate with Stripe to manage subscriptions, process payments, and handle all your billing needs.
- **E-commerce:** Build a full-featured online store with our e-commerce APIs, including product management, inventory, and order processing.
- **No Database Headaches:** We handle the database for you, so you can focus on building your application without worrying about a complex backend setup.
- **Custom Logic:** Extend our platform with your own custom code to build unique features and workflows.

With the Gately SDK, you get the best of both worlds: the speed and convenience of a no-code platform with the power and flexibility of a custom backend.
