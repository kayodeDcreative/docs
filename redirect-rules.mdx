# Redirect Rules System

Our Redirect Rules System allows you to manage your URL redirects and control user navigation after specific events. This is a powerful tool for improving your user experience, guiding users through your application, and optimizing your funnels.

## Key Features

### URL Redirect Management
Create and manage your URL redirects from a single dashboard. You can add new redirects, edit existing ones, and delete them as needed.

### Pattern-Based Redirects with Wildcards
Our system supports pattern-based redirects with wildcards, allowing you to redirect a group of pages with a single rule. For example, you can use a wildcard to redirect all pages under a certain path.

### 301/302 Redirect Types Support
Choose between 301 (permanent) and 302 (temporary) redirect types to suit your needs.

### Active/Inactive Toggle
Easily activate or deactivate your redirect rules with a single click. This allows you to quickly enable or disable a redirect without having to delete and recreate the rule.

### Priority Ordering for Rule Execution
If you have multiple redirect rules that could apply to the same URL, you can set a priority for each rule to determine which one should be executed first.

## Use Cases

You can define specific navigation paths for your users after key actions:

-   **After Signup:** Redirect new users to a welcome page, a quick start guide, or their new dashboard.
-   **After Login:** Guide returning users to their dashboard, the last page they visited, or a specific feature page.
-   **After Plan Purchase:** Navigate users to a confirmation page, a thank you message, or a page highlighting the new features they've unlocked.

## New Page

-   `/dashboard/redirect-rules`: The main dashboard for managing your redirect rules.
