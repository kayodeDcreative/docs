# Redirect Rules System

Our new Redirect Rules System allows you to manage your URL redirects with ease. This is a powerful tool for improving your SEO, fixing broken links, and creating a better user experience for your audience.

## Key Features

### 🔄 URL Redirect Management
Create and manage your URL redirects from a single dashboard. You can add new redirects, edit existing ones, and delete them as needed.

### 🧩 Pattern-Based Redirects with Wildcards
Our system supports pattern-based redirects with wildcards, allowing you to redirect a group of pages with a single rule. For example, you can use a wildcard to redirect all pages under a certain path.

### 🔢 301/302 Redirect Types Support
Choose between 301 (permanent) and 302 (temporary) redirect types to suit your needs.

###  toggles
Easily activate or deactivate your redirect rules with a single click. This allows you to quickly enable or disable a redirect without having to delete and recreate the rule.

### 📊 Priority Ordering for Rule Execution
If you have multiple redirect rules that could apply to the same URL, you can set a priority for each rule to determine which one should be executed first.
