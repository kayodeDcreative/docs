# E-commerce Shop System

Our new E-commerce Shop System provides a complete solution for selling products directly from your website. From product management to order tracking and analytics, you have everything you need to run a successful online store.

## Key Features

### Complete Product Management
Manage your products with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. You can add new products, update existing ones, and remove them from your catalog as needed.

### Product Catalog with Search and Filtering
Your customers can easily browse your products through a clean and intuitive catalog interface. The built-in search and filtering capabilities help them find exactly what they're looking for.

### Order Management System
Track and manage orders from the moment they're placed until they're fulfilled. The order management system includes status tracking, so you and your customers always know the current state of an order.

### Shop Analytics
Gain valuable insights into your shop's performance with our analytics dashboard. Track sales metrics, monitor trends, and make data-driven decisions to grow your business.

### CSV Import/Export
Save time by managing your products in bulk. You can import and export your product catalog as a CSV file, making it easy to add or update a large number of products at once.

### Product Variants
Sell products with different options, such as size, color, or material. Our e-commerce system supports product variants, allowing you to manage different versions of the same product.

### Inventory Tracking
Keep track of your stock levels with our inventory management feature. The system automatically updates your inventory as products are sold, helping you avoid overselling.

### Shop Settings
Configure your payment and shipping options to suit your business needs. Our shop settings page allows you to set up your preferred payment gateways and define your shipping rules.
