## What is Gately?

Gately is a comprehensive authentication and user management platform designed specifically for no-code and low-code environments. We bridge the gap between complex authentication systems and the simplicity that no-code platforms demand.

### Built for No-Code First

Unlike traditional authentication services that require extensive coding knowledge, Gately was designed from the ground up to work seamlessly with no-code platforms like Webflow, Bubble, Framer, and others. Our visual configuration interface and pre-built components make authentication accessible to everyone.

- **Visual authentication flows** with drag-and-drop simplicity
- **Customizable UI components** that match your brand
- **Pre-built integrations** for popular no-code platforms

### Why No-Code Matters

The no-code revolution is democratizing software development, allowing entrepreneurs, designers, and business users to build powerful applications without writing code. However, authentication has remained a complex barrier until now.

- **Faster time-to-market** for no-code applications
- **Accessible to non-technical teams** and founders
- **Enterprise-grade security** without enterprise complexity
