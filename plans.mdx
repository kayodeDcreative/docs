Manage user plans, tiers, and feature access with the Gately SDK.

## Stripe Integration for Plan Management

Gately's plan management system is designed to seamlessly integrate with your Stripe account, allowing you to monetize your application with ease.

### Creating and Syncing Plans

To get started, you first need to connect your Stripe account in the Gately dashboard. Once connected, you can create your subscription plans directly within Gately. These plans will be automatically synced with your Stripe account, creating corresponding products and prices. This means you only have to manage your plans in one place, and the changes will be reflected in both Gately and Stripe.

### Charging Users

With your Stripe account connected and plans created, you can start charging your users. Our SDK provides the necessary tools to handle subscriptions, ensuring a smooth checkout process for your customers.

### Content Gating with the SDK

The Gately SDK empowers you to control access to different parts of your application based on a user's subscription plan and authentication status. You can easily gate pages, features, or specific content, ensuring that only users with the appropriate permissions can access them. This allows you to create tiered access levels and provide exclusive content to your subscribers.
