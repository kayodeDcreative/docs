Gately automatically manages your website's UI elements based on whether users are logged in or not. This means you can create personalized experiences without any coding.

## How UI Control Works

Once you add Gately to your site, it automatically:

- **Shows login forms** when users need to authenticate
- **Hides login buttons** when users are already signed in
- **Displays user dashboards** only to authenticated users
- **Shows welcome messages** to new visitors
- **Controls access** to premium content based on user plans

## What Gets Controlled Automatically

- **Login Forms** - Appear when users need to sign in
- **Signup Forms** - Show when new users need to register
- **Logout Buttons** - Display when users are signed in
