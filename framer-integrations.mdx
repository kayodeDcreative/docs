## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your Embed Script

1. Go to [https://app.usegately.com/dashboard/settings/installation](https://app.usegately.com/dashboard/settings/installation)
2. Select **Framer** as your platform
3. Copy the generated embed script

The script will automatically include your project ID and domain settings.

### Step 2: Add Script to Framer

1. In Framer, go to **Settings** â†’ **Custom Code**
2. Paste the script into the **`<head>` section**
3. **Publish your site** - Gately will be active!

<Note>
The dashboard generates a personalized script with your actual project details. The domain and slug are automatically configured based on your Framer site settings.
</Note>

## How It Works

Once you add the embed script to your Framer site, Gately automatically:

- **Detects authentication needs** on your pages
- **Injects authentication forms** where needed
- **Handles user sessions** across your site
- **Provides user management** features
- **Manages redirects** and navigation

The script is lightweight and won't affect your site's performance.
