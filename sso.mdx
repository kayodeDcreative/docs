Single Sign-On (SSO) allows your users to sign in using their existing accounts from popular providers like Google and GitHub. This makes registration and login faster and more convenient for your users.

## Available SSO Providers

## How SSO Works

Once you enable SSO providers in your Gately dashboard, users will automatically see social login buttons on your authentication forms:

### User Experience
1. **User clicks social login button** (e.g., "Sign in with Google")
2. **Redirected to provider** - User goes to Google/GitHub to authenticate
3. **User authorizes your app** - User grants permission to access their profile
4. **Automatic account creation** - Gately creates an account if it's their first time
5. **User returns to your site** - Logged in and ready to use your application

### Automatic Features
- **Profile sync** - User's name, email, and avatar are automatically imported
- **Account linking** - If user already has an account, SSO gets linked to it
- **Session management** - User stays logged in across visits
- **Security** - All OAuth flows are handled securely by Gately

## Dashboard Configuration

### Step 1: Enable SSO Providers
1. Go to **Settings** → **Authentication** → **Social Login**
2. **Toggle on** the providers you want to use (Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. **Configure each provider** with your OAuth credentials

### Step 2: Configure Provider Settings

## Authentication Modes

### Desktop Experience

- **User stays on your page** - No page reload required
- **Automatic popup closing** - Popup closes after successful authentication
- **Error handling** - Graceful error messages if authentication fails
