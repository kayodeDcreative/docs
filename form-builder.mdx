# Form Builder System

Our new Form Builder System provides a complete solution for creating and managing forms on your website. With a drag-and-drop interface, custom form fields, and detailed analytics, you can build any type of form you need, from simple contact forms to complex surveys.

## Key Features

### Drag-and-Drop Form Builder
Create beautiful and functional forms with our intuitive drag-and-drop editor. No coding required. Simply drag and drop form fields to build your form, and customize it to match your brand.

### Custom Form Fields
Our form builder supports a wide range of form fields, including:
- Text
- Email
- Select
- Checkbox
- Radio
- File upload
- And more...

### Form Submissions Tracking and Management
Track and manage your form submissions from a single dashboard. You can view, edit, or delete submissions, and export them as a CSV file.

### Form Analytics
Gain valuable insights into your form's performance with our analytics dashboard. Track conversion rates, monitor trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve your forms.

### Conditional Logic
Create dynamic forms that show or hide fields based on the user's input. Our conditional logic feature allows you to build complex forms that are tailored to each user.

### Form Settings
Configure your form's settings to suit your needs. You can set up email notifications, redirect users to a thank you page, and customize the form's styling.

### Public Form Hosting
Host your forms on a public URL, making it easy to share them with your audience. Each form you create is given a unique URL, which you can share on social media, in emails, or anywhere else.

### Framer Webhook Integration
Integrate your forms with Framer to automatically send submissions to your Framer project.

### CSV Export
Export your form submissions as a CSV file, making it easy to analyze your data in your favorite spreadsheet tool.

### Form Duplication
Duplicate your forms to quickly create new forms with the same settings.
