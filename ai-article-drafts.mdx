# AI Article Drafts Feature

Our new AI Article Drafts feature uses the power of artificial intelligence to automatically generate help articles from your helpdesk tickets and Gmail conversations. This is a great way to quickly build up your knowledge base and provide your customers with the information they need.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Article Generation
Our system uses a powerful AI model to generate high-quality articles from your helpdesk tickets and Gmail conversations.

### Draft Management System
Generated articles are saved as drafts, which you can then review, edit, and approve before publishing. The draft management system includes status tracking (draft → reviewing → approved/rejected → published).

### Source Tracking
Our system tracks the source of each article, whether it was generated from a helpdesk ticket, a Gmail conversation, or another AI source.

### Review Workflow
The review workflow allows you to approve or reject drafts, ensuring that only high-quality content is published to your knowledge base.

### One-Click Publishing
Once a draft has been approved, you can publish it to your knowledge base with a single click.
