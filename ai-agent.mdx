# AI Agent System

Gately's AI Agent System is a powerful new feature that brings autonomous task execution and intelligent automation to your fingertips. Our AI agent can perform a wide range of tasks, from generating articles to analyzing support tickets, all while learning and adapting to your needs.

## Key Features

### Autonomous AI Agent
Our AI agent is designed to operate independently, executing complex tasks in the background without requiring your constant attention. It maintains a persistent state and execution context, allowing it to handle long-running processes and learn from its interactions.

### Smart Task Execution
The AI agent is equipped with research and interaction capabilities, enabling it to gather information, analyze data, and make intelligent decisions. It can understand the context of a task and devise a plan to achieve the desired outcome.

### Background Task Processing
Offload time-consuming tasks to the AI agent and let it work in the background. Whether you need to generate a series of help articles or analyze a batch of customer feedback, the agent can handle it all, freeing you up to focus on more strategic initiatives.

### Agent Dashboard
Monitor and manage your AI agent's activities through a dedicated dashboard. You can view the status of ongoing tasks, review completed work, and intervene when necessary. The dashboard provides a transparent and intuitive interface for overseeing the agent's operations.

### Draft Card Management
The AI agent can generate content and save it as a draft for your review. The draft card management system allows you to easily edit, approve, or reject the agent's work, ensuring that you have the final say on all generated content.
