# Gated Content System

Our Gated Content System allows you to restrict access to certain parts of your website based on a user's plan or authentication status. This is a powerful tool for creating members-only content, monetizing your website, and providing exclusive access to your most valuable resources.

## Key Features

### Content Access Control
Restrict access to your content based on a user's subscription plan or whether they are logged in. You can create rules that apply to specific pages, files, or links.

### URL Pattern Matching
Our system supports URL pattern matching, allowing you to protect a group of pages with a single rule. For example, you can use a wildcard to protect all pages under a certain path.

### Multiple Access Types
You can choose from three access types:
- **Plan-based**: Only users with a specific subscription plan can access the content.
- **Auth-based**: Only logged-in users can access the content.
- **Both**: Users must be logged in and have a specific subscription plan to access the content.

### Custom Redirect Messages
Customize the message that is displayed to users who do not have permission to access the content. You can also redirect them to a different page, such as a sales page for the required subscription plan.

### Content Type Support
You can protect three types of content:
- **Links**: Hide links from users who do not have permission to see them.
- **Pages**: Restrict access to entire pages.
- **Files**: Protect your files from unauthorized access.

### Active/Inactive Toggle
Easily activate or deactivate your content rules with a single click. This allows you to quickly enable or disable access to your content without having to delete and recreate your rules.

### Plan-Based Restrictions
Our system supports multiple subscription plans, allowing you to create different tiers of access for your users.
