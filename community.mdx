# Community & Discussion System

Build a vibrant community around your brand with our new Community & Discussion System. This feature allows you to host organized conversations, moderate comments, and engage with your audience in a meaningful way.

## Key Features

### Channel-Based Discussions
Organize conversations into channels based on topics, products, or any other category you choose. This helps keep discussions focused and makes it easy for users to find the information they're looking for.

### Comment Threads with Nested Replies
Our system supports nested replies, allowing users to have in-depth conversations within a thread. This makes it easy to follow the flow of a conversation and respond to specific comments.

### Comment Moderation
Keep your community safe and productive with our moderation tools. You can approve, reject, or delete comments to ensure that the conversation stays on topic and respectful.

### User Avatars and Profiles
Users can express their identity with customizable avatars and profiles. This helps to create a more personal and engaging experience for your community members.

### Comment Reactions
Users can react to comments with likes, thumbs up, or other emojis. This provides a quick and easy way for users to show their appreciation or agreement with a comment.

### Channel Management
Create and manage your channels from a dedicated dashboard. You can add new channels, edit existing ones, and set custom topics for each channel.

### Search and Filtering
