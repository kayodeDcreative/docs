## How It Works

Once you add the embed script to your Webflow site, Gately automatically:

- **Detects authentication needs** on your pages
- **Injects authentication forms** where needed
- **Handles user sessions** across your site
- **Provides user management** features
- **Manages redirects** and navigation

The script is lightweight and won't affect your site's performance.
