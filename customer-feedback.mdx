# Customer Feedback System

Our new Customer Feedback System makes it easy to collect, manage, and showcase feedback from your customers. This is a great way to gather valuable insights, identify areas for improvement, and build social proof.

## Key Features

### Public Feedback Submission Endpoint
We provide a public endpoint for submitting feedback, so your customers can share their thoughts without having to log in.

### Feedback Management Dashboard
Manage your feedback from a dedicated dashboard with a tabbed interface:
- **All feedback view**: View all the feedback you've received.
- **Pending approval queue**: Review new feedback before it's published.
- **Published feedback**: View the feedback that is visible to the public.
- **Testimonials collection**: View the feedback that you've marked as a testimonial.

### Star Rating System
Our feedback system includes a 1-5 star rating system, with validation to ensure that the ratings are accurate.

### Customer Profiles
Each piece of feedback is associated with a customer profile, which includes their avatar, name, email, and company.

### Approval Workflow
You have full control over which feedback is published. You can approve or reject feedback from the pending approval queue.

### Testimonial Marking
Mark your best feedback as a testimonial to showcase it on your website.

### CRUD Operations
Manage your feedback with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## New Page

- **/dashboard/helpdesk/feedback**: The main dashboard for managing your customer feedback.
