# Webhook System

Our new Webhook System allows you to send automated messages from your Gately account to other applications. This is a powerful tool for integrating with third-party services, automating your workflows, and creating custom solutions.

## Key Features

### 🎣 Webhook Management with CRUD Operations
Manage your webhooks with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. You can add new webhooks, update existing ones, and remove them as needed.

### 🚀 Event-Based Triggers
Our webhook system is event-based, meaning that webhooks are triggered when a specific event occurs in your Gately account. You can choose from a wide range of events, such as a new user signing up, a form being submitted, or a new order being placed.

### 📦 Webhook Payload Tracking and History
Track the payloads of your webhooks and view a history of all the webhooks that have been sent. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your integrations.

### 🔄 Retry Mechanism for Failed Webhooks
If a webhook fails to be delivered, our system will automatically retry sending it several times. This helps to ensure that your integrations are reliable and that you don't lose any data.

### 🧪 Webhook Testing with Sample Payloads
Test your webhooks with sample payloads to ensure that they are working correctly. This is a great way to debug your integrations without having to trigger the actual events.

### 📜 Detailed Webhook Logs with Request/Response Data
View detailed logs of all your webhooks, including the request and response data. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your integrations.

## New Pages

- **/dashboard/webhooks**: The main dashboard for managing your webhooks.
- **/dashboard/webhooks/:id**: View the details of a specific webhook.
- **/dashboard/webhooks/:id/payloads/:payloadId**: View the payload of a specific webhook.

## Database

The webhook system uses two new database tables:
- `webhooks`: To store your webhooks.
- `webhook_payloads`: To store the payloads of your webhooks.
