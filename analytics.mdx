# Analytics & Tracking

Gately provides comprehensive analytics and tracking capabilities to help you understand user behavior, measure form performance, and track custom events across your application.

## Overview

The analytics system includes:
- **Event Tracking**: Track custom user interactions
- **Form Analytics**: Monitor form performance and conversions
- **User Behavior**: Understand user journeys and patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Measure application performance
- **Custom Properties**: Add context to your analytics data

## Event Tracking

### Basic Event Tracking

Gately's SDK allows you to track simple events, like button clicks, and associate them with user actions and page URLs. You can also add user context to your events, such as their subscription tier.

### Custom Event Properties

You can add detailed properties to your events to capture rich, contextual data. This is useful for tracking complex interactions, like viewing a product, and including details like the product ID, name, category, price, and more.

### User Journey Tracking

Our analytics system allows you to track a user's progression through your application. You can record which step of a journey a user is on, how long they spend on each page, and how far they scroll.

## Form Analytics

### Automatic Form Tracking

Gately automatically tracks form-related events, such as submissions. You can also manually track form views and interactions to get a more detailed picture of how users are engaging with your forms.

### Form Performance Metrics

You can track form completion rates, the time it takes for users to complete a form, and how many fields were filled out. You can also track form abandonment to identify which fields are causing users to drop off.

## User Behavior Tracking

### Page Views and Navigation

Gately can track page views, including the page URL, title, referrer, and user agent. You can also track navigation events to see how users move between different pages of your site.

### User Engagement

Our analytics system can track how long users spend on a page and how far they scroll. This helps you understand which content is most engaging to your users.

## React Integration

Gately provides a React hook that makes it easy to integrate our analytics into your React application. You can use the hook to track events, get user information, and monitor user behavior within your components.

## Performance Tracking

### Application Performance

Our analytics system can track page load performance, including the time it takes for the DOM to load, the first paint, and the first contentful paint.

### API Performance

You can use Gately to track the performance of your API calls. Our analytics can record the duration of each call and whether it was successful or not.

## Custom Analytics Dashboard

### Building Custom Reports

Gately allows you to track conversion funnels and other custom journeys. You can define the steps of a funnel and track how many users complete each step.

### A/B Testing

Our analytics system can be used to track A/B test variations and conversions. This allows you to see which version of a page or feature is performing better.

## Error Tracking

### Application Errors

Gately can automatically track JavaScript errors and unhandled promise rejections. This helps you identify and fix bugs in your application.

### User-Reported Issues

You can use our analytics to track user-reported issues. This allows you to collect feedback from your users and prioritize bug fixes.

## Privacy and Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

Gately provides tools to help you comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations. You can check for user consent before tracking and respect user privacy preferences.

### Data Anonymization

Our analytics system allows you to anonymize sensitive data, such as email addresses and IP addresses, to protect user privacy.
