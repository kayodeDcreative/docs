## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your Embed Script

Get your personalized embed script from the Gately dashboard:

1. Go to https://app.usegately.com/dashboard/settings/installation
2. Select **Framer** as your platform
3. Copy the generated embed script

### 2. Add Script to Framer

Install the script in your Framer site:

1. In Framer, go to **Settings** â†’ **Custom Code**
2. Paste the script into the **`<head> section`**
3. **Publish your site** - Gately will be active\!

Your embed script will look like this:

```html
<script 
  src="https://cdn.usegately.com/gately.min.js" 
  data-project-id="your-project-id" 
  data-domain="https://yoursite.framer.website/" 
  data-base-domain="YourDomain.com" 
  data-slug="your-slug">
</script>
```

The script automatically includes:

- **`data-project-id`** - Your unique Gately project ID
- **`data-domain`** - Your Framer site domain
- **`data-base-domain`** - Your custom domain (if configured)
- **`data-slug`** - Your site slug

<Note>
  The dashboard will generate this script with your actual project details. The domain and slug are automatically configured based on your Framer site settings.
</Note>

## How It Works

Once you add the embed script to your Framer site, Gately automatically:

- **Detects authentication needs** on your pages
- **Injects authentication forms** where needed
- **Handles user sessions** across your site
- **Provides user management** features
- **Manages redirects** and navigation

The script is lightweight and won't affect your site's performance.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and behavior through the Gately dashboard:

### Theme Customization

- **Colors** - Match your brand colors
- **Typography** - Choose fonts and sizes
- **Layout** - Adjust spacing and borders
- **Components** - Select which features to show

### Authentication Options
