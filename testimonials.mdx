## How It Works

### 1. Import
Grab all your existing testimonials from over 30 platforms or just drag in a CSV. Once imported, Gately makes is simple to organize, tag, filter, and share them right away.

### 2. Collect
Create and share testimonial forms in no time. Gately handles video and text collection automatically, even transcribing videos you collect natively for easy review.

### 3. Manage & Analyze
Tag and sort your testimonials by customer type, product, or sentiment. Use Gately’s smart sentiment analysis to instantly spot what your customers love — and which products or features they keep raving about.

### 4. Share
