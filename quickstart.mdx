# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get Gately integrated with your website in less than five minutes.

## Step 1: Create Your Gately Project

First, you'll need a Gately account and a project to work with.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up for Gately">
    If you don't have an account, [sign up for free](https://app.usegately.com).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Project">
    Once you're in the dashboard, create a new project and give it a name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note Your Project ID">
    You'll find your Project ID on the project's main dashboard. Keep it handy, as you'll need it to connect your site to Gately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Install Gately on Your Site

Next, you'll add the Gately script to your website. This is a small, lightweight script that handles all the Gately functionality on your site.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy the Script">
    In your Gately dashboard, go to **Settings → Installation** and copy the embed script.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste the Script in Your Site's <head>">
    Open your website's settings in your platform of choice (Framer, Webflow, etc.) and paste the script into the custom code section, inside the `<head>` tag.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish Your Site">
    Save your changes and publish your site. Gately is now installed!
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Note>

## Step 3: Configure and Test

With Gately installed, you can now configure your authentication and branding.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Authentication">
    In your Gately dashboard, go to **Settings → Authentication** and enable the login methods you want to offer, such as email/password, magic links, or social logins.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Your Branding">
    Go to **Settings → Branding** to upload your logo and set your brand colors. Gately’s components will automatically match your site's styling.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the User Flow">
    Open your published website and try signing up or logging in. You should see your test user appear in your Gately dashboard under the "Users" tab.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## You're All Set!

That's it! Gately is now live on your site, and you have a complete authentication and user management system up and running.
