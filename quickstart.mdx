## Step 1: Dashboard Setup

### Create Your Project

1. Go to [https://app.usegately.com](https://app.usegately.com)
2. **Sign up** for a free account
3. **Create a new project** with your site name
4. **Note your Project ID** - you'll need this later

### Configure Basic Settings

1. Go to **Settings** → **General**
2. Set your **site domain** (e.g., `yoursite.com`)
3. Choose your **default language**
4. Set your **timezone**

### Enable Authentication

1. Go to **Settings** → **Authentication**
2. Enable **Email/Password** authentication
3. Optionally enable **Magic Link** or **Social Login**
4. Configure **sign-up fields** (name, email, etc.)

## Step 2: Add to Your Website

### Get Your Embed Script

1. Go to **Settings** → **Installation**
2. Select your platform (Framer, Webflow, etc.)
3. Copy the generated embed script

### Add to Your Platform

#### For Framer:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Custom Code**
2. Paste the script into the **`<head>` section**
3. **Publish your site**

#### For Webflow:
1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Custom Code**
2. Paste the script into the **`<head>` section**
3. **Publish your site**

#### For Other Platforms:
1. Find your platform's custom code section
2. Paste the script into the **`<head>` section**
3. **Publish your site**

<Note>
The embed script is lightweight and won't affect your site's performance. It automatically detects when authentication is needed and shows the appropriate forms.
</Note>

## Step 3: Test Your Setup

### Test Authentication

1. **Visit your published site** (not the editor)
2. **Look for authentication elements** - they'll appear automatically
3. **Try signing up** with a test email
4. **Check your dashboard** - the user should appear in your user list

### Test Different Flows

- **Sign up flow**: Create a new account
- **Login flow**: Sign in with existing account
- **Password reset**: Test the forgot password feature
- **Email verification**: Check if verification emails are sent

## Step 4: Customize Appearance

2. Upload your **logo**
3. Set your **brand colors**
4. Choose your **font family**
