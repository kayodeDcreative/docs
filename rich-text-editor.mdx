# Rich Text Editor Enhancements

Our rich text editor, based on TipTap, has been upgraded with a host of new features to give you more control over your content. These enhancements are designed to make it easier to create structured, visually appealing, and engaging content.

## Key Features

### ሠ Table Support
You can now create and manage tables directly within the editor. This is perfect for displaying data, comparing features, or organizing information in a structured format.

### 📣 Advanced Callout Extension
Our new callout extension supports multiple types, allowing you to highlight important information with a specific tone. The available types are:
- `info`: For general information or tips.
- `warning`: To draw attention to potential issues or important caveats.
- `success`: To highlight positive outcomes or successful actions.
- `error`: To indicate problems or critical warnings.

### 💬 Bubble Menu
The new bubble menu provides inline formatting options that appear when you select text. This makes it quick and easy to apply formatting without taking your hands off the keyboard.

### 🖼️ Image Upload and Embedding
You can now upload images directly to the editor and embed them in your content. This is a significant improvement over the previous system, which required you to enter an image URL manually.

### 🔗 Link Management
The link management feature has been improved, making it easier to add, edit, and remove links.

### 📏 Text Alignment
You can now align your text to the left, right, or center, giving you more control over the layout of your content.

### <u> Underline Support </u>
The editor now supports underline formatting, in addition to bold and italics.
